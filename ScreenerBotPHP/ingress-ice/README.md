Download
========
### Stable
See [releases](https://github.com/nibogd/ingress-ice/releases) to download the latest stable version. 
On linux, you may need to install these [dependencies](https://github.com/nibogd/ingress-ice/wiki/Dependencies-(Linux)).
### Development
> *WARNING!* the development version may be unstable.

You can download the whole ingress-ice using the 
[![Download ZIP](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2771136/12703381/36d9adb4-c85b-11e5-81b1-ec0dbef9f679.png)]
(https://github.com/nibogd/ingress-ice/archive/master.zip) 
button on the top or clone this repo via git from the link on top. You will need to manually download PhantomJS binary for your platform and put it into `phantomjs.exe` at the root of repo if you are using windows or `phantomjs` otherwise.

PhantomJS binaries' downloads are located [here](http://phantomjs.org/download.html).

To build archives for every operating system, launch `./build.sh`.
It will automatically download PhantomJS executables and pack them with Ingress ICE.

Usage
=====
> *WARNING!* ingress-ice may be considered against Ingress ToS (although it hasn't happened before). Use it at your own risk!

### Windows
 1. Unpack the archieve wherever you want
 2. Double-Click `ingress-ice.cmd` and follow the instructions
 3. It will save captured screenshots with into `ice-2014-07-13--09-13-37.png`, `ice-2014-07-13--09-14-07.png`...
 4. You can copy `ice/ingress-ice.conf.sample` to `ingress-ice.conf` in the ice root and enter your settings there, so you can have different configurations for every `ingress-ice`

If you want to reconfigure the script, just double click `reconfigure.cmd`. If you want to use cookies instead of login and password, see [cookies authentication](https://github.com/nibogd/ingress-ice/wiki/Cookies-Authentication).

### Linux/Mac OS X
 1. Unpack the archieve wherever you want
 2. Run `chmod +x ingress-ice.sh&&./ingress-ice.sh` in console and follow the instructions
 3. It will save captured screenshots with into `ice-2014-07-13--09-13-37.png`, `ice-2014-07-13--09-14-07.png`...
 5. You can run it from any folder where you want to save screenshots.

If you want to reconfigure the script, 
run `./ingress-ice.sh -r`. 
If you want to use cookies instead of login and password, 
see [cookies authentication](https://github.com/nibogd/ingress-ice/wiki/Cookies-Authentication). 
In case Ingress ICE crashes sometimes, run it with option `-s`: it will run ICE in an endless loop.

#### Creating videos
To create a video from your screenshots, you can use *MPlayer* [(Windows download)](http://oss.netfarm.it/mplayer-win32.php) (install from your repo if on linux). It includes a `mencoder` command. The following will produce an `.avi` video:
(Detailed instruction for windows [here](https://github.com/nibogd/ingress-ice/wiki/Creating-videos-(Windows)))
```
mencoder mf://*.png -mf w=1366:h=768:fps=4:type=png -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4:mbd=2:trell -oac copy -o ingress-ice.avi
```

Change 1366 and 768 to your width and height, fps=4 to your FPS (more FPS - faster video, but shorter)
